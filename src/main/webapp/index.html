<p>
    This website currently provides two webservice calls. Each takes a http get and returns a list of
    flight info in JSON format.

</p>
<p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    Upon request, the webservice will scrape a live updated
<a href="http://www.aucklandairport.co.nz/FlightInformation/InternationalArrivalsAndDepartures.aspx"> webpage</a>
and return the flight info in json format.
The arrival list is easier to get than the departure list. A simple http get will do the trick.
However, the departure list on the other hand requires a http get and http post
(bloody .net __viewstate crap) and another get to grab the page I want.
With this webservice, it is possible to create client apps (like a phone app) that do not rely on
Auckland Airport's webpage. So when they change their webpage, instead of publishing a new app to accommodate their changes, you can rely on this webservice to change the internal implementation. So the actual websites
change will have no effect at all to your phone apps.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
This site is deployed on Google App Engine. It is VERY slow in fetching some remote webpages. Sometimes, it just
times out. Future work is create a queue of webpage scrapping workers to do the fetching. So the webservice can
simple return the latest cached results and never gives you 500 error hopefully.
By returning cached results, it will be also good for DDOS attacks and avoiding big bills from google.
